          <p class="text-white-50">
              <b style="color: aliceblue">Individual Impact</b>

          <p class="text-white-50">
              <b style="color: aliceblue">Fellow Impact</b> -
              The success and impact of the cohort depends largely on the success of ALL the Fellows within it. Hence, empowering and supporting the work of other fellows enables your own success.

          <p class="text-white-50">
              <b style="color: aliceblue">Community Impact</b>
              - The creation of modular artifacts in a way that makes it accessible for others to use in their respective work.
